# explain your design choices, the challenges you faced, and how you approached responsiveness.

I initially used chatgpt but then switched over entirely to claude. 
I asked claude to write me a css file using the style specifications in the inline code of the html files I provided.
I also asked for it to erase the inline style code from the html lines. This resulted in the css file given and the adjusted
html files.

There were some errors, so I made few adjustments: mainly changing the font, and changing the centering of the headers.

Before I started coding, I checked the "inspect source" tools on the website for the responsiveness of my page.
Thankfully, somehow the page was already responsive. This was true also for the css-added pages.

I also had some issues with referencing the css file correctly which caused some misunderstanding of nothing changing on the page.

I am amazed and somewhat suspicious that ai can help me create these so quickly. Most of my hijinks were uploading the files
to linux and also fixing some errors and referencing file paths. While I feel uncomfortable asking so much from chatgpt than 
manually coding it, the small manual errors and time it took to simply complete this makes it feel somewhat rewarding.
